  - Rewards you for practicing the same recipe instead of only rewarding you when you first try it
  - Organizes cooking lessons by type of meal, appealing to what different users may be seeking
  - Iconography and illustrations make the app more fun to use

I would like to build an app that allows you to store a workout routine with video examples that play offline. The app would have all these demonstrative videos in a database associated with the exercise and muscle they work. Users would be able to filter and find workouts by muscle, intensity, or other aspects. They would be able to select and favorite certain exercises to build out their routine and even designate certain days for them, building a routine on a virtual calendar. Users can also record their personal stats and performance with the exercises, being assisted with progressive overload with an AI trainer who reviews their performance metrics and advises new goals for the user's next workout session.

## Notes

I tried to improve the app even more by adding a button that changes text color, but I could not figure out how to apply the backend logic as I was unsure how to differentiate the action for a UILabel rather than UIColor. I did successfully add an image and different color text.
